# Japanese Vocabulary Learning App

A modern SwiftUI application designed to help users learn and review Japanese vocabulary, specifically tailored for the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). The app features an interactive and intuitive user interface built with a custom design system.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Tab Bar**: A custom, animated tab bar that supports both tapping and dragging gestures for seamless navigation.
- **Vocabulary Collection**: Browse and manage collections of Japanese vocabulary words, starting with a built-in list for JLPT N1.
- **Clean, Modern UI**: Built entirely with SwiftUI, showcasing modern iOS development patterns and a custom design system for a consistent look and feel.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project is structured into distinct modules for a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and scale.
- **Type-Safe Navigation**: Utilizes a custom router for robust and type-safe navigation throughout the app.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project adopts a clean, modular architecture inspired by MVVM principles. The primary goal is to separate concerns, making the codebase more testable, scalable, and easier to reason about.

- **UI**: The user interface is built entirely with **SwiftUI**.
- **Design System**: A dedicated `ZeroDesignKit` module provides reusable and consistent UI components, such as the `AppTabBar`.
- **Navigation**: The app uses a custom, centralized `AppRouter` for type-safe navigation, preventing common routing errors and making the navigation flow explicit.
- **View-ViewModel**: The app loosely follows an MVVM pattern, with ViewModels like `AppTabsViewModel` and `HomeViewModel` managing the state and logic for their respective views.
- **Modularity**: The codebase is broken down into several Swift Packages:
  - `DomainKit`: Contains the core business logic, models, and protocols.
  - `ZeroDesignKit`: A custom UI component library.
  - `ZeroCoreKit`: Provides core utilities shared across the app, such as the `NavigationRouter`.
  - `DataKit`: Responsible for data handling and persistence (e.g., fetching vocabulary from the included CSV).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `JapaneseDictionaryApp.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on your desired simulator or physical device.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Swift 5 & SwiftUI
- Swift Concurrency (async/await)
- Swift Package Manager for modular architecture
